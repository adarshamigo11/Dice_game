# Dice_game

I have developed a simple web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which determines the winner upon refreshing the page. This project was created for fun and as a way to practice complex JavaScript concepts. I intend to upload the code to GitHub to share it with others and showcase my skills in web development. Additionally, it serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to apply advanced JavaScript techniques in a practical project. This game provides an enjoyable experience for users, while also serving as a learning tool for those interested in web development and JavaScript programming. By making the project available on GitHub, I aim to contribute to the development community and inspire others to explore similar projects. Overall, this project demonstrates my dedication to learning and improving my coding skills.
